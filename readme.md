</h3>

Afara is a non-profit organization from WÃ¼rzburg, Germany aiming to support educational and youth welfare projects in Africa.

This site is built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [Contentful](https://contentful.com).

## Setup

Running this site locally requires [`git`](https://git-scm.com) and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) (or [`npm`](https://npmjs.com)). With those installed, do:

1. Clone the repo and change into its directory.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/janosh/afara && cd afara
   ```

2. (optional) Setup [`git` hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) by setting `core.hooksPath` and granting execute permission.

   ```sh
   git config core.hooksPath src/utils/gitHooks
   && chmod -R u+x src/utils/gitHooks
   ```

3. Install dependencies.

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then open `.env` and insert your [Contentful space ID and access token](https://contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication). These are found in the settings menu of a Contentful space under 'API keys'.

5. Start the dev server.

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
