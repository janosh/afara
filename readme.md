Afara is a non-profit organization from WÃ¼rzburg, Germany aiming to support educational and youth welfare projects in Africa.

This site is built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [Contentful](https://contentful.com).

## Setup

Running this site locally requires [`git`](https://git-scm.com) and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) (or [`npm`](https://npmjs.com)). With those installed, do:

1. Clone the repo and change into its directory.
